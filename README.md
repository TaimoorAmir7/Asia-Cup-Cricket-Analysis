# Asia Cup Cricket Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting match outcomes in the **Asia Cup Cricket Tournament** using **machine learning techniques**. The dataset is processed, visualized, and used to build predictive models for forecasting match results.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring match data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key patterns and trends.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models to forecast match outcomes.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using metrics like confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
